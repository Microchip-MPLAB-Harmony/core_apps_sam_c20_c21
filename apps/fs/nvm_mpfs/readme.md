# MPFS filesystem using NVM Media

This application shows an example of implementing a MPFS disk in device Internal Flash memory.

## Description

### File System Operations on NVM:

- The application contains a MPFS disk image in the internal Flash memory. The disk image contains two files named:
  - **FILE.txt**, Size = **11 Bytes**. The content of the file is: **"Hello World"**
  - **TEST.txt**, Size = **10 Bytes**. The content of the file is: **"1234567890"**

- The application performs following file system related operations:
  - **SYS_FS_FileRead**
  - **SYS_FS_FileStat**
  - **SYS_FS_FileSize**
  - **SYS_FS_FileSeek**
  - **SYS_FS_FileEOF**

- The contents of both the files are read and compared with the expected strings as mentioned above. If the string compare is successful, An LED indication is provided.

### File system layer uses:

- Memory driver to communicate with underlying NVM media
