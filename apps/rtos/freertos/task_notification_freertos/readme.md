# FreeRTOS Task Notification

This example application is to illustrate the FreeRTOS Task Notification feature which is used as a light weight binary semaphore.

## Description

- This demonstration creates two tasks that send notifications back and forth to each other.
  - Task2 blocks to wait for Task1 to notify and will be blocked for 500ms
  - Task1 sends a notification to Tasks2, bringing it out of the blocked state, toggles an LED
  - Task1 blocks to wait for Task2 to notify
  - Task2 sends notification to Task1, bringing it out of the blocked state

- Above steps will be repeated. i.e. an LED toggles for every 500ms
