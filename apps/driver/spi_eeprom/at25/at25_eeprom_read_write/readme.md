# SPI EEPROM AT25 driver - EEPROM Read Write

This example application shows how to use the AT25 driver to perform read and write operations on AT25 series of EEPROM.

## Description

This example uses the AT25 driver to communicate with the SPI based AT25 series of external EEPROMs to perform write and read operations in Bare-Metal environment.

### Setting up [SAMC21N Xplained Pro Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/atsamc21n-xpro)

- To run the demo, the following additional hardware are required:
  - [EEPROM 4 click board](https://www.mikroe.com/eeprom-4-click)
  - [mikroBUS Xplained Pro board](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/ATMBUSADAPTER-XPRO)

- Install an [EEPROM 4 click board](https://www.mikroe.com/eeprom-4-click) on to the [mikroBUS Xplained Pro board](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/ATMBUSADAPTER-XPRO)
- Connect [mikroBUS Xplained Pro board](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/ATMBUSADAPTER-XPRO) to the EXT2 header
- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

## Running the Application

1. Build and program the application using its IDE
2. The LED is turned ON when the value read from EEPROM matches with the written data

Refer to the following table for LED name:

| Board | LED Name |
| ----- | -------- |
|  [SAMC21N Xplained Pro Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/atsamc21n-xpro) | LED0 |
